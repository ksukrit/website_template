Hey ! I'm Sukrit a Master's student in School of Computer Science at GeorgiaTech. I'm interested in working on problems in the intersection of Machine Learning and large-scale systems. I'm currently a member of the [SAIL] lab at GeorgiaTech.

Previously, I was a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research India](https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/india/) where I worked on problems related to container-platform reliability and developer productivity. I also had the opportunity to work with some of the best people in the industry there.

Prior to that, I interened at ShareChat AI working on building infra around their large-scale Recommendation Systems. I graduated from BITS Pilani in 2023.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
